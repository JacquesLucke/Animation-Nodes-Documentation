## Mix Falloff

A new *Subtract* method was added to the node.

## Radial Falloff

A new *Radial Falloff* node was added. The value of the falloff is equal to the
normalized angle along a plane, with an input offset phase.

## Object Controller Falloff

A new *Radial* mode was added. The mode is identical to the aforementioned
*Radial Falloff* where the center and normal of the plane are controlled by the
location and local axis of the controller object.

A new *Create Trigger* operator was added in the *Advanced Node Settings*. The
operator creates execution triggers on the input object's transforms as needed.

## Remap Falloff

A new *Interpolation* input was added. The remapped range will be evaluated at
the input interpolation if it is not linear.
