## Mix Falloff

A new *Subtract* method was added to the node.

## Radial Falloff

A new *Radial Falloff* node was added. The value of the falloff is equal to the
normalized angle between the projection of two vectors on the plane defined by
the inputs. The first vector is the positive x axis and the second vector is the
vector in question.

## Object Controller Falloff

A new *Radial* mode was added. The mode is identical to the aforementioned
*Radial Falloff* where the center and normal of the plane are controlled by the
location and local axis of the controller object.

A new *Create Trigger* operator was added in the *Advanced Node Settings*. The
operator creates execution triggers on the input object's transforms as needed.

## Remap Falloff

A new *Interpolation* input was added. The remapped range will be evaluated at
the input interpolation if it is not linear.

## Clamp Falloff

A new *Clamp Falloff* node was added. The node clamps falloff value to a certain range.
