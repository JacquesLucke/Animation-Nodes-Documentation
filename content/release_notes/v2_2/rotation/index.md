## Separate Quaternion

The *Separate Quaternion* node is now vectorized.

## Combine Quaternion

The *Combine Quaternion* node is now vectorized.

## Mix Quaternion

The *Mix Quaternion* now uses a spherical interpolation which is more suitable
for rotations than standard linear interpolation. Additionally, the node is now
vectorized.

## Random Quaternion

The *Random Quaternion* node now has a *Create List* option which allows the
creation for a list of quaternions.

## Convert Rotations

The *Convert Rotations* node was vectorized.
