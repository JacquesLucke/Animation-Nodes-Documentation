## Random Boolean

The *Random Boolean* node was added. This node generates a random boolean or a
list of random booleans. The probability of truth is controllable.

## Compare Numbers

The *Compare Numbers* node was added. This node is similar to the standard
compare node but it is specific to numbers only, vectorized, and much faster to
use as it is implemented natively.
