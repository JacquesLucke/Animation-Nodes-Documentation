## LSystem

A new *LSystem* node was added.

{{< video lsystem.mp4 >}}

## Decompose Text

A new *Decompose Text* node was added. It provides a completely new workflow
for dealing with text in Animation Nodes. The node takes a text and decomposes
it into characters, words, or lines. Then it returns the decomposed characters,
words, or lines with their transformations in order to position them in space.
A typical use of the node follows the same structure of the following example.

{{< video decompose_text.mp4 >}}

## Text Object Output

The bottom baseline vertical alignment option can now be used.

## Font Socket

The pick operator of the font socket was replaced by a *Load Font* operator.
If invoked, the user will be prompted to select a font to load from disk.
