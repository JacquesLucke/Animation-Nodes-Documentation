The Data Interface node is a special node that allows other python scripts to
communicate with Animation Nodes by passing data or getting data from it.
Passing data can be done by calling the `setValue` method on the node and
getting data can be done by calling the `getValue` method on the node. The
interface type should be set accordingly.
