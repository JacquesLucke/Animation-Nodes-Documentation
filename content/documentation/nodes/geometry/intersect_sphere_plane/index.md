title : Intersect Sphere Plane
---

## Description

This node returns the intersection circle of input sphere and plane. A
plane intersects a sphere in a circle, the node returns the radius and
location of this circle.

## Illustration

Orange point is the center of the blue intersected circle.

## Inputs

- **Sphere Center** - The location of the center of the required
    sphere.
- **Sphere Radius** - The radius length of the required sphere.
- **Plane Point** - A point on the required plane.
- **Plane Normal** - A unit vector that represent the normal of the
    required plane.

## Outputs

- **Circle Center** - The location of the center of the intersected
    circle.
- **Circle Radius** - The radius length of the intersected circle. If
    this values is zero and *Is Valid* is True, that that means that the
    plane is tangent to the sphere at the *Circle Center*.
- **Is Valid** - A boolean which is True if an intersection was found,
    and False otherwise.
