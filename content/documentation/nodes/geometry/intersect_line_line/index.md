title : Intersect Line Line
---

## Description

This node takes two lines and returns the locations of two points (one
on each of them) that are closest to each other. If the lines intersect,
that is, they are not skew, then the two points will be equal to the
point of intersection.

## Illustration

Blue points are the input points and orange points are the output
points. Orange points are the closest points on the lines.

## Inputs

- **Line 1 Start** - The location of the starting point of the first
    line.
- **Line 1 End** - The location of the ending point of the first line.
- **Line 2 Start** - The location of the starting point of the second
    line.
- **Line 2 End** - The location of the ending point of the second
    line.

## Outputs

- **Closest On Line 1** - The location of the closest point on line 1.
- **Closest On Line 2** - The location of the closest point on line 2.
- **Is Valid** - A boolean which is True if a closest pair was found
    and False if not. Closest pair won't be found only if both lines
    were parallel.
