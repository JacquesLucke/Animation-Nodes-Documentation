title : Convert Plane Type
---

## Description

This node converts between the two representations of 3D planes,
Point-Normal representation and Transformation Matrix representation.

Not to be mistaken by the primitive mesh plane, planes in this context
are mathematical objects that can be defined by a normal and a location
or a transformation matrix since matrices can encode both the normal and
the location of the plane.

## Options

- **Point/Normal To Matrix** - This option will encode the input
    location and the input normal of the plane into a transformation
    matrix.
- **Matrix To Point/Normal** - This option will decode the input
    transformation matrix and return the location and the normal of the
    plane represented by that transformation matrix.

## Inputs

- **Point In Plane** - A vector that correspond to the location of a
    point in the plane. (Only in the Point/Normal To Matrix option)
- **Plane Normal** - A unit vector that correspond to the normal of
    the plane. (Only in the Point/Normal To Matrix option)
- **Matrix** - A transformation matrix that represent the plane. (Only
    in the Matrix To Point/Normal option)

## Outputs

- **Point In Plane** - A vector that correspond to the location of a
    point in the plane. (Only in the Matrix To Point/Normal option)
- **Plane Normal** - A unit vector that correspond to the normal of
    the plane. (Only in the Matrix To Point/Normal option)
- **Matrix** - A transformation matrix that represent the plane. (Only
    in the Point/Normal To Matrix option)
