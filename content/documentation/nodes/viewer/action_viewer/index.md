## Description

This node visualizes an action on a floating viewer. The visualization is
composed of multiple rows, each row evaluates the action on a specific index
starting from zero at the top and increasing by one as its goes down. Actions
are drawn as rectangles whose width is their duration and whose location is
their starting time. Some actions such as the *Delay Action* can visualize
themselves as multiple actions that they are composed of.
