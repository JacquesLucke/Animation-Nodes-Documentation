# Vector

### Data Types

- **Vector** - A 3D vector.
- **Vector 2D** - A 2D vector.

### Sockets

- **Vector Socket** - It can intake or output the vector(s). This socket has *node link conversion*
    for vector to float and euler, and vectors to spline and mesh. This socket has *implicit conversion*
    for 2D vector(s) to 3D vector(s).
- **Vector 2D Socket** - It can intake or output the 2D vector(s). This socket has *implicit conversion*
    for 3D vector(s) to 2D vector(s).
