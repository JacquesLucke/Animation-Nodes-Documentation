title : Revolve Splines
---

## Description

This node creates a mesh from the input splines by revolving the profile
spline around the axis spline.

## Options

- **Project** - This option will sample some points from the profile
    spline, project them on the axis spline and then revolve each point
    around its projection.This method output a nicer result especially
    if the axis and profile splines are different in length but it is
    much slower due to the projection process.
- **Same Parameter** - This option will sample some point from both
    the profile and the axis splines and revolve each point around its
    corresponding point. This method have difficulties especially if the
    axis and the profile splines are different in length since
    corresponding points will be far from each other and thus resulting
    distortion however this method is genrally much faster than the
    Project method.

## Inputs

- **Axis** - A spline that is used as the source of pivots for the
    revolving.
- **Profile** - A spline in which spline samples are originated for
    revolving.
- **Spline Samples** - The number of points sampled for revolving.
- **Surface Splines** - The number of points sampled during revolving.

## Outputs

- **Vertices** - A vector list that contains the vertices locations of
    the output mesh.
- **Polygons** - A polygon indices list that carries the polygons
    information of the output mesh.
