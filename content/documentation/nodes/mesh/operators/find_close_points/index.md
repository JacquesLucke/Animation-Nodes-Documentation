## Description

This node takes a vector list (Usually represent the location of some
points) and return edge indices list that represent some connection
between those input points.

## Options

- **Amount** - This option lets you define the amount of connections
    that each point should have.
- **Distance** - This option lets you define a distance, if the
    distance between a point and another is less that distance, a
    connections is initialized between them.

## Inputs

- **Points** - A vector list that contain points locations.
- **Amount** - The amount of connections each point have. (Only
    available in the Amount option)
- **Max Distance** - The maximum distance each connection is allowed
    to have. (only available in the Distance option)

## Outputs

- **Edges** - An edge indices list that represent the connections.
- **Distances** - A float list that contains the lengths of the edges
    defined by the output edge indices and the input point locations.
