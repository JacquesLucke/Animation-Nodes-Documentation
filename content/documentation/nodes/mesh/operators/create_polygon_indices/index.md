title : Create Polygon Indices
weight : 60
---

## Description

This node creates a polygon indices which then can be used to create a
polygon indices list to create meshes.

## Options

- **Vertex Amount** - This option generates a polygon indices of a
        specific number of vertices with the sequence `0,1,2,...`.

    - **Use list** - It is the option you see beside the menu, if
        enabled, the node will expect a list of vertices amounts and
        the output will be a polygon indices list that include
        polygon indices of corresponding vertices amounts with the
        sequence `0,1,2,...`.

- **Indices** - This options convert an integer list to a polygon
    indices list.

## Inputs

- **Indices** - An integer list that contain all the indices of the
    vertices that form the polygon. (Only available in Indices option)
- **Vertex amount(s)** - The amount of vertices of the polygon, if
    this input was 3, the output polygon indices will be `0,1,2`. (Only
    available in Vertex Amount option)

## Outputs

- **Polygon Indices** - The resulted polygon indices.
