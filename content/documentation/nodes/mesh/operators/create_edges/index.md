## Description

This node creates edges based on two vectors lists that define the
locations of the terminals of the edges.

## Inputs

- **Edge Starts** - A vector list that represent the vertices
    locations of the starts of the edges.
- **Edge Ends** - A vector list that represent the vertices locations
    of the ends of the edges.

## Outputs

- **Vectors** - A vector list that represent the vertices locations of
    the edges.
- **Edge Indices List** - Edges indices that describe the connection
    between each corresponding vectors.
