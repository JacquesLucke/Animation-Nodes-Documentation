weight : 30
---

## Description

This node recalculate the normals of vertices of the input bmesh.

It is often that the created mesh will have zero normals---The magnitude
of the normals is zero---and you will have to recalculate the normals by
using this node.

## Inputs

- **Bmesh** - An Input Bmesh.

## Outputs

- **Bmesh** - The resulted Bmesh.
