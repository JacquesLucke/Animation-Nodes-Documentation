title : Slice List
---

## Description

This node outputs only a portion of the input list.

## Options

- **Start** - Defines the start index of the output list. So if the input list
  is `[1,2,3,4]` and Start value is 2 then the new list will be `[3,4]` that's
  because the node will reject the elements before that index and output a list
  that starts from that index. If disabled, start will be considered zero.
- **End** - Defines the ending index of the output list. So assuming the start
  is 0 and end is 2 the output list in the previous example will be `[1,2,3]`
  that's because the node will reject the elements after that index and output
  a list that ends by that index.
- **Step** - Defines the step size between each index. So if the step size is
  equal to 2 then the output list will be `[1,3]` notice that the index jumped
  2 values to get from 1 to 3 and that what the step size defines.
- **Index** - The end element is defined by its index.
- **Length** - The end element is defined automatically by providing the length
  of the output list.

## Inputs

- **List** - An input list.
- **Start** - The starting index of the output length.
- **End/Length** - The ending index or the length of the output list.
    (Based on the chosen option)
- **Step** - The step size of the output list.

## Outputs

- **List** - The sliced list.

## Advanced Node Settings

- **Change type** - Change the type of the list to another list type.
