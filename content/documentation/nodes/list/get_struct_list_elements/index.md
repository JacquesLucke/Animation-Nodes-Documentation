## Description

This node takes a list of structs and output all the values of a specific
common key between them.

If a list of structs all have a key named `Name` and you want to output all the
texts in that key, you first have to convert the type of the node to be Text
because Name key is a text and then type `Name` in the field.

## Inputs

- **Struct List** - A list of structs.

## Outputs

- **Data** - A list of values based on the type you choosed.
