title : Remove List Element
---

## Description

This node removes certain list elements based on their index or their
values.

## Options

- **First Occurrence** - This option removes the input value at its first
  appearance only. So if the input value is `1` and the input list is
  `[1,2,3,1]` the output list will be `[2,3,1]`. Notice that the last 1 didn't
  change.
- **All Occurrence** - This option removes all the input values from the list.
  So for the previous example the output list will be `[2,3]`.
- **Index** - This option removes the element at the input index. So for the
  previous example with input index as 1 then the output will be `[1,3,1]`
  because 2 was at index 1.

## Inputs

- **List** - An input list.
- **Value/Index** - The index of the element or its value (Based on the
  selected option).

## Outputs

- **List** - The edited list.

## Advanced Node Settings

- **Change type** - Change the type of the list to another list type.
