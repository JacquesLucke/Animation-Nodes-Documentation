title : List boolean Operations
---

## Description

This node is used to do mathematical set operations like Union,
Intersection, Difference, and Symmetric Difference.

## Options

- **Union** - This operation adds the 2 input lists but unlike the combine list
  node. If an element is shared between the 2 lists it will be considered as a
  single element. So input list `[1,2,3]` Union input list `[3,4,2]` outputs
  `[1,2,3,4]`.
- **Intersection** - This node will return a list of elements that are common
  between the 2 input lists. So input list `[1,2,3]` intersection input list
  `[3,4,5]` outputs `[3]`, because it is shared between the 2 lists.
- **Difference** - This operation will remove the elements of input list 1 from
  input list 2. So if input list `[1,2,3]` difference input list `[3,4,5]`
  outputs `[1,2]`. Notice that 3 was removed because it is in list 2.
- **Symmetric Difference** - This operation return the elements from both lists
  if those elements are not shared between both lists. So input list `[1,2,3]`
  Symmetric Difference input list `[3,4,5]` output `[1,2,4,5]`. Notice that 3
  was not included because it is in both lists.

## Inputs

- **List 1** - An input list.
- **List 2** - An input list.

## Outputs

- **List** - The result of the set operation.
