## Description

This node is a 1D noise generator, you can think of it as random numbers that
are smoothly connected to each other.

It is a function of variable **Evolution**, which means every value of the
variable **Evolution** has a corresponding value calculated based on the node
options and this value is the output of the node.

## Options

- **Node Seed** - Aside from the *Seed input*, this extra seed parameter
  enables you to get different random numbers if the *Seed input* in not free,
  that is, it is dependent on some property that you can't freely control, for
  instance, when using multiple *Random Number* nodes in a loop while using the
  index as a seed, you can change the node seed to get different numbers for
  each node.  Animation Nodes automatically changes the *Node Seed* when you
  duplicate or add a new *Random Number* node.

## Inputs

- **Seed** - Seed for the random generator, where different seed generate
  different vectors.
- **Evolution** - A float at which the noise is evaluated.
- **Speed** - It is the frequency of the noise or the rate of change of the
  values.
- **Amplitude** - It is the maximum possible value for the absolute of the
  output number.
- **Octaves** - It is the number of perlin noises that constructs the noise
  function, where the noise function is the superposition of `n` number of
  perlin noise with different frequencies where `n` is the Octaves input.
- **Persistance** - The magnitude of the added higher frequency octaves, the
  magnitude of each octave is directly proportional to its frequency.

## Outputs

- **Number** - The output of the noise function at the variable **Evolution**.
