title : Parse Number
---

## Description

This node is used to convert a text that include numbers into a float.

## Inputs

- **Text** - The string that should be converted into float.

## Outputs

- **Number** - The float that was extracted from the input text.

## Advanced Node Settings

- N/A

## Caution

The input text should only include numbers, otherwise the node will return a
parsing error. White spaces around single numbers are rejected, for instance,
`(spaces)5(spaces)` will be parsed but `(spaces)5(spaces)4(spaces)` will not be
parsed because there are two numbers.
