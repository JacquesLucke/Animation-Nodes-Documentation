title : Euler Wiggle
---

## Description

This node generates a random euler by generating a 1D noise in all of its
components.

## Options

- **Node Seed** - Aside from the *Seed input*, this extra seed parameter
  enables you to get different random eulers if the *Seed input* in not free,
  that is, it is dependent on some property that you can't freely controle, for
  instance, when using multiple *Random Euler* nodes in a loop while using the
  index as a seed, you can change the node seed to get different eulers for
  each node.  Animation Nodes automatically changes the *Node Seed* when you
  duplicate or add a new *Random Euler* node.
- **Create List** - It is the button you see beside the *Node Seed*, if it is
  enabled, the output will be a list of random eulers.

## Inputs

- **Seed** - Seed for the random generator, where different seed generate
  different eulers.
- **Evolution** - A float at which the noise is evaluated.
- **Speed** - It is the frequency of the noise or the rate of change of the
  values.
- **Amplitude** - An euler that represents the element wise maximum of the
  absolute of the components of the output euler.
- **Octaves** - It is the number of perlin noises that constructs the noise
  function, where the noise function is the superposition of `n` number of
  perlin noise with different frequencies where `n` is the Octaves input.
- **Persistance** - The magnitude of the added higher frequency octaves, the
  magnitude of each octave is directly proportional to its frequency.

## Outputs

- **Euler** - The output euler of the noise functions at the input
  **Evolution**.
