title : FCurve Keyframes
---

## Description

This node return the location and the value of the keyframes that
composed the FCurve.

For instance, If one were to animate the x location of an object he would
insert a keyframe at the frame `0` when the object location was `0` and another
keyframe at the frame `20` when the location of the object was `5`. An fcurve
would be created as a result of this animation and this node will return two
lists, **KeyFrames Frames** which will contain `[0,20]` which is the location
of our frames and **KeyFrames Values** which will contain `[0,5]` which is the
x locations of our frames.

## Inputs

- **FCurve** - An input fcurve.

## Outputs

- **Keyframes Frames** - A float list that contain the locations of
    the frames that composed the input fcurve.
- **Keyframes Values** - A float list that contain the values of the
    frames that composed the input fcurve.
